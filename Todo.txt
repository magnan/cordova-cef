TODO
----

X Fix C:\images hardcoded path
X Clean close of camera window
X Make sure the user can't click the record until the stream is displaying
X Preserve user selected choice
X Background in lower part of window
X Does Francois want a way for user to cancel?
- Handle alt-F4 in capture window
  ? Ask Francois how the application is quit
X Handle clicking X while recording somehow
  ! If callback receives 0 (Canceled) it must delete file if present
X Check and clean the gitignore vs VS files
X Scrollbars are red
  ? Can't reproduce problem
X Very difficult to click on camera buttons on tablette
# Take photo is broken
  - Need to handle PHOTO_TAKEN event correctly and not close the engine right away
    - Maybe correct handling of events will fix waiting for camera initialized
  # No action if not previewing
X Button at left to cycle available cameras
- Minimize flicker when clicking buttons
- What is desired behavior if something goes wrong?
  - At the moment, it pops an error box and... not sure...
- General review and cleanup of all the code
- Delete cancelled video from C++
  - Make sure code like changing device that stops the preview also cancels recording and deletes the video
X Remember camera!?
  X In persistent settings!? Yes but not for now
    X Same for Video / Photo might as well!?
X Sound on click!?
- Finish all the buttons cleanly going selected, then back to not selected
- Gambit embedded
  - Hack something so we can return a string to javascript
    - Fix hack with Marc's help
    - Make sure hack doesn't leak memory


QUESTIONS
---------

X Is it ok to use a Windows 8 only API? Yes
X Is it possible to render into an HTML 'control'? Too involved. Simply use WinGDI
X No png for hover? Not needed as we are on a tablette
X No png for disabled? Do not show
X What is the deadline? 15 may or mercredi
X SVG, Skia, ...
