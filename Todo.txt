TODO
----

X Fix C:\images hardcoded path
X Clean close of camera window
- Do we need to make sure the user can't click the record until the stream is displaying? Yes
  ? Not much we can do as the Windows MF_CAPTURE_ENGINE_PREVIEW_STARTED message is called immediately
X Preserve user selected choice
X Background in lower part of window
X Does Francois want a way for user to cancel?
- Handle alt-F4 in capture window
  ? Ask Francois how the application is quit
X Handle clicking X while recording somehow
  ! If callback receives 0 (Canceled) it must delete file if present
X Check and clean the gitignore vs VS files
- JS function to call shell-command (system!?)
  ? Use ShellExecute or like Gambit use
    > (##get-shell-program)
    ("sh" . "-c")
X Scrollbars are red
  ? Can't reproduce problem
X Very difficult to click on camera buttons on tablette
- Take photo is broken
  - Need to handle PHOTO_TAKEN event correctly and not close the engine right away
    - Maybe correct handling of events will fix waiting for camera initialized
  - For now, using a Sleep(500) hack
- Button at left to cycle available cameras
  - Remember camera!?
- Minimize flicker when clicking buttons


QUESTIONS
---------

X Is it ok to use a Windows 8 only API? Yes
X Is it possible to render into an HTML 'control'? Too involved. Simply use WinGDI
X No png for hover? Not needed as we are on a tablette
X No png for disabled? Do not show
X What is the deadline? 15 may or mercredi
X SVG, Skia, ...
